//! One test binary for the origin suites: GitHub collaboration through the in-
//! memory forge and the origin poller.
//!
//! Each module below was a test binary of its own. The files are unchanged
//! apart from reaching the shared helpers as `crate::support`, so a test is
//! named `<module>::<test>` and an edit upstream relinks one binary here
//! instead of one per file.
